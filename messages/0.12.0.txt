0.12.0
------

All new in November.

-

I think mostly I reworked the visuals.  By default, I now show the basic
file stats, like mtime and size.  Norton Commander vibes.

The default can be changed by the setting `dired_show_stats`, and dynamically
using `S`.

I also highlight, stylize copied or cut files, and generally show more help
in the heading line and status bar.

If you're using your standard theme, you might want to define the scopes
`dired.copied` and `dired.cut`.  Maybe take a look at the README to see
how all of that might look like.

-

I implement back and forth navigation, bound to `alt+left` and `alt+right`.
And a quick way to expand or collapse folder with `ctrl+.` and `ctrl+,`.

The fuzzy searcher (`i`) automatically expands to sub-folders if there is no
match btw.  That should lead to something useful over time, I think.

-

I removed the popups on the gutter for now; and previewing a directory just
opens a split view.  That should also lead to something more useful, where
we maybe have multiple folders open side-by-side and navigate between them
using `tab`/`shift+tab`.

-

`dired_width` (the setting) and `dired_select` (the command) now have different
(better, more dynamic) default behavior.  So if you changed their usage before,
maybe you don't need to anymore.


That's enough for this series.
Pre 🎄 already.
