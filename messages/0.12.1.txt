0.12.1
------

A faster incremental search and saner hidden-file defaults.

- First round of search speed-ups: incremental search now reuses cached
  directory listings, cutting the work per keystroke.

- Hidden files now line up with Sublime’s own sidebar: we honor
  `folder_exclude_patterns` (and `binary_file_patterns` while searching),
  so a fresh dired view matches what the sidebar shows. Use
  `dired_hidden_files_patterns` only for extra excludes.

- Windows: the filesystem hidden attribute still applies while hiding is on.
