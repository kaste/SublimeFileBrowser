0.8.5
-----

The plugin is alive again and has a new home at https://github.com/kaste/SublimeFileBrowser.

Only a few bug fixes went into this release.  There is just one very noteable
change: we now use your color scheme (e.g. a dark one) instead of ours.
However, we still ship our color scheme and use it for the
shortcuts/help view.  You can turn that back on in the settings if you prefer.

The next release will have more fixes and will run on ST4/python 3.8 only.  Stay tuned.
