I've implemented live, fuuzzy filtering.  Yeah!

Press "/" or "i", to open an input box at start typing to narrow the directory
listing.  "Enter" to commit that filter, "Escape" to undo.

If you have an active filter -- you likely notice the highlighted, matching
chars -- you can use "I" to toggle the filter.

On top of that, "*" now filters the listing by the extension of the file under
the cursor.  Both filters can be used at the same time.

🤔... 👍
